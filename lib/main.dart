  "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.\nI love thee to the depth and breadth and height\nMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sight\nFor the ends of being and ideal grace.\nI love thee to the level of every day's\nMost quiet need, by sun and candle-light.\nI love thee freely, as men strive for right.\nI love thee purely, as they turn from praise.\nI love thee with the passion put to use\nIn my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.\nI love thee with a love I seemed to lose\nWith my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,\nSmiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,\nI shall but love thee better after death.",
  'Looking up at the stars, I know quite well\nThat, for all they care, I can go to hell,\nBut on earth indifference is the least\nWe have to dread from man or beast.\n\nHow should we like it were stars to burn\nWith a passion for us we could not return?\nIf equal affection cannot be,\nLet the more loving one be me.\n\nAdmirer as I think I am\nOf stars that do not give a damn,\nI cannot, now I see them, say\nI missed one terribly all day.\n\nWere all stars to disappear or die,\nI should learn to look at an empty sky\nAnd feel its total dark sublime,\nThough this might take me a little time.',
  'You are a ukulele beyond my microphone\nYou are a Yukon beyond my Micronesia\nYou are a union beyond my meiosis\nYou are a unicycle beyond my migration\nYou are a universe beyond my mitochondria\nYou are a Eucharist beyond my Miles Davis\nYou are a euphony beyond my myocardiogram\nYou are a unicorn beyond my Minotaur\nYou are a eureka beyond my maitai\nYou are a Yuletide beyond my minesweeper\nYou are a euphemism beyond my myna bird',
  "Shall I compare thee to a summerâ€™s day?\nThou art more lovely and more temperate.\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\nAnd summerâ€™s lease hath all too short a date.\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimmed;\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\nBy chance, or natureâ€™s changing course, untrimmed;\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade,\nNor lose possession of that fair thou owâ€™st,\nNor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,\nWhen in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.\n    So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,\n    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.",
  "There is a kind of love called maintenance\nWhich stores the WD40 and knows when to use it\n\nWhich checks the insurance, and doesnt forget\n\nThe milkman; which remembers to plant bulbs;\nWhich answers letters; which knows the way\nThe money goes; which deals with dentists\n\nAnd Road Fund Tax and meeting trains,\nAnd postcards to the lonely; which upholds\n\nThe permanently rickety elaborate\nStructures of living, which is Atlas.\n\nAnd maintenance is the sensible side of love,\nWhich knows what time and weather are doing\nTo my brickwork; insulates my faulty wiring;\nLaughs at my dryrotten jokes; remembers\nMy need for gloss and grouting; which keeps\nMy suspect edifice upright in air,\nAs Atlas did the sky.",
  "When, in disgrace with fortune and menâ€™s eyes,\nI all alone beweep my outcast state,\nAnd trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,\nAnd look upon myself and curse my fate,\nWishing me like to one more rich in hope,\nFeatured like him, like him with friends possessed,\nDesiring this manâ€™s art and that manâ€™s scope\nWith what I most enjoy contented least;\nYet in these thoughts myself almost despising,\nHaply I think on thee, and then my state,\n(Like to the lark at break of day arising\nFrom sullen earth) sings hymns at heavenâ€™s gate;\nFor thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings\nThat then I scorn to change my state with kings.",
  "What sound was that?\n\nI turn away, into the shaking room.\n\nWhat was that sound that came in on the dark?\nWhat is this maze of light it leaves us in?\nWhat is this stance we take,\nTo turn away and then turn back?\nWhat did we hear?\n\nIt was the breath we took when we first met.\n\nListen. It is here.",
  "I think I was searching for treasures or stones\nin the clearest of pools\nwhen your faceâ€¦\n\nwhen your face,\nlike the moon in a well\nwhere I might wishâ€¦\n\nmight well wish\nfor the iced fire of your kiss;\nonly on water my lips, where your faceâ€¦\n\nwhere your face was reflected, lovely,\nnot really there when I turned\nto look behind at the emptying airâ€¦\n\nthe emptying air.",
  "Itâ€™s all I have to bring todayâ€”\nThis, and my heart besideâ€”\nThis, and my heart, and all the fieldsâ€”\nAnd all the meadows wideâ€”\nBe sure you countâ€”should I forget\nSome one the sum could tellâ€”\nThis, and my heart, and all the Bees\nWhich in the Clover dwell."
